- **Off-chain Secure Storage**:
    - IPFS for agent models (encrypted)
    - ArWeave for immutable agent versions
    - Encrypted data vaults for user data (with ZK proofs for access)
- **Caching**: Redis clusters for inference optimization

- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: For data access verification without revealing data
- **Threat Monitoring**: Decentralized security nodes scanning for anomalies
- **Governance Security**: Multi-sig requirements for critical protocol changes

### Messaging & Events

- **L2 Event System**: On-chain event logs for key operations
- **Messaging Protocol**: libp2p for node-to-node communication
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connections with blockchain watchers

### Monitoring & Analytics

- **Network Health**: OpenSearch and New Relic for node performance and network stability
- **Economic Analytics**: OpenSearch for token flows, DEX activity, and rewards distribution
- **Performance Metrics**: New Relic for inference latency, success rates, and user satisfaction
- **Dashboards**: OpenSearch-powered analytics platform with data from indexed blockchain events

## Security Implementation

### Network Security

- **Validator Consensus**: Modified Proof-of-Stake with inference quality metrics
- **Sybil Resistance**: High staking requirements and reputation tracking
- **DDoS Protection**:
    - Geographic distribution of inference nodes
    - Stake-weighted request routing
    - Rate limiting based on token holdings

### Data Security

- **Agent Model Protection**:
    - Encrypted storage on IPFS
    - ZK-proofs for verification without exposure
    - Versioned immutable records on ArWeave
- **User Data Protection**:
    - Client-side encryption
    - Granular access control via data tokens
    - Homomorphic encryption for sensitive inferences

### Transaction Security

- **Multi-signature Requirements**: For high-value operations
- **Fraud Detection**: On-chain anomaly detection for unusual transaction patterns
- **Time-Locks**: For significant token movements
- **Circuit Breakers**: Automatic pausing of DEX activities if unusual volatility detected

## Tokenomics

### Utility Token

- Used for gas fees on the L2 network
- Staking for inference node operation
- Governance rights for protocol upgrades

### Agent Tokens

- Represent ownership in specific agents
- Revenue sharing from agent usage
- Voting rights on agent development direction

### Data Tokens

- Represent access rights to specific datasets
- Privacy-preserving data sharing
- User compensation for data contributions

## Inference Node Requirements

### Hardware Requirements

- GPU/TPU capabilities for model inference
- Minimum bandwidth and latency guarantees
- Storage capacity for caching and models

### Staking Requirements

- Minimum stake in native tokens
- Slashing conditions for poor performance or malicious behavior
